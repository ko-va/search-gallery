#Flickr based image gallery
Build a simple single-page application that creates an image gallery with images from
Flickr.

##Before You Start
• You should write the code ”from scratch” – no third party libraries (like jQuery)
allowed!
• Focus on code maintainability

##Application Flow
1. User navigates to a page where he/she finds a search form
2. User types a search string and press enter (or clicks a search button)
3. Images that matches the search string in Flickr is presented to the user
4. The user selects one or multiple images that he/she wants to be part of the gallery
5. The user can now either click a ”Show Gallery”­button or make a new search
6. When the user clicks "Show Gallery", the selected images should be presented, one
by one

Notes
● Optionally, make a nice design accompanied by nice and slick CSS
● No backend is needed, but OK to use if wanted
● No database is needed, but OK to use if wanted
● Target browser for the task is Chrome (desktop)
